Spyne Models and Native Python Types
====================================

There are five types of models in Spyne:

* **Primitive:** These are basic models that can contain a single value at a time.
  Primitive types are more-or-less present in any programming language and all
  of them map to a well-defined Python type. Types like ``Integer``,
  ``Decimal``, ``Float``, ``String``, ``Date`` are all primitives. See the
  documentation for :mod:`spyne.model.primitive` for more info.

* **Enum:** Custom types that can take only a pre-determined number of values.
  It's also possible to get enum-like behavior with primitives as well. Enums
  are defined using the :class:`spyne.model.enum.Enum` class.

* **Binary:** Binary types are used to represent arbitrarily-long byte streams.
  There are two binary types in Spyne: The
  :class:`spyne.model.binary.ByteArray` and the
  :class:`spyne.model.binary.File` class. While any sequence of ``str``
  instances can be used as ``ByteArray``, the ``File`` only works with a
  ``File.Value`` instance. Please see the relevant example below for a more
  thorough explanation.

* **Complex:** Complex objects are subclasses of the
  :class:`spyne.model.complex.ComplexModel` class. They are hierarchical
  container classes that can contain any type of object. Two well known
  examples are the
  :class:`spyne.model.complex.Array` and
  :class:`spyne.model.complex.Iterable` types.
  They are just specialized complex objects.

* **Fault:** When an exception is thrown from the user code, it's serialized
  and returned to the client as a :class:`spyne.model.fault.Fault`. If it is
  not a subclass of ``Fault``, the client will probably see this
  as an internal error. Some of the most common exceptions that a web service
  might need to throw can be found in the :mod:`spyne.error` module.

Before going into detail about each category of models, we will first talk
about an operation that applies to all models: Type Customization.

Customization
-------------

Model customization is how one adds declarative restrictions and other metadata
to a Spyne model. This model metadata is stored in a generic object called
``Attributes``. Every Spyne model has this object as a class attribute.

As an example, let's customize the vanilla ``Unicode`` type to accept only valid
email strings: ::

  class EmailString(Unicode):
      __type_name__ = 'EmailString'

      class Attributes(Unicode.Attributes):
          max_length = 128
          pattern = '[^@]+@[^@]+'

You must consult the reference of the type you want to customize in order to
learn about which values it supports for its ``Attributes`` object.

As this is a quite verbose way of doing it, Spyne offers an in-line
customization mechanism for every type: ::

    EmailString = Unicode.customize(
            max_length=128,
            pattern='[^@]+@[^@]+',
            type_name='EmailString',
        )

Here, ``type_name`` is a special argument name that gets assigned to
``__type_name__`` instead of the ``Attributes`` class.

Calling simple types directly is a shortcut to their customize method: ::

    EmailString = Unicode(
            max_length=128,
            pattern='[^@]+@[^@]+',
            type_name='EmailString',
        )

As restricting the length of a string is very common, the length limit can be
passed as a positional argument as well: ::

    EmailString = Unicode(128,
            pattern='[^@]+@[^@]+',
            type_name='EmailString',
        )

It's actually also not strictly necessary (yet highly recommended) to pass a
type name: ::

    EmailString = Unicode(128, pattern='[^@]+@[^@]+')

When the ``type_name`` is omitted, Spyne auto-generates a type name for the
new custom type basing on the class it's used in.

Type customizations can also be anonymously tucked inside other class
definitions: ::

    class User(ComplexModel):
        user_name = Unicode(64, pattern='[a-z0-9_-]')
        email_address = Unicode(128, pattern='[^@]+@[^@]+')

Do note that calling ``ComplexModel`` subclasses instantitates them. That's why
you should use the ``.customize()`` call, or plain old subclassing to customize
complex types: ::

    class MandatoryUser(User):
        class Attributes(User.Attributes):
            nullable=False
            min_occurs=1

or: ::

    MandatoryUser = User.customize(nullable=False, min_occurs=1)

Primitives
----------

Using primitives in functions are very simple. Here are some examples: ::

    class SomeSampleServices(ServiceBase):
        @srpc(Decimal, Decimal, _returns=Decimal)
        def exp(x, y):
            """Exponentiate arbitrary rationals. A very DoS friendly service!"""
            return x ** y

        utcnow = @srpc(_returns=DateTime)(datetime.utcnow)

        @srpc(Unicode, _returns=Unicode)
        def upper(s):
            return s.upper()

        # etc.

Let's now look at them group by group:

Numbers
^^^^^^^

Numbers are organized in a hierarchy, with the
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Decimal` type  at the top.
In its vanilla state, the ``Decimal`` class is the arbitrary-precision,
arbitrary-size generic number type that will accept just *any* decimal
number.

It has three direct subclasses: The arbitrary-size
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Integer` type and the machine-dependent
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Double` or
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Float` (which are synonyms as Python does not
distinguish between floats and doubles) types.

Unless you are absolutely, positively sure that you need to deal with
arbitrary-size numbers, (or you're implementing an existing API) you
should not use the arbitrary-size types in their vanilla form.

You must also refrain from using :class:`spyne.model.primitive.Float` and
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Double` types unless you need your math to
roll faster as their representation is machine-specific, thus not very
reliable nor portable.

For integers, we recommend you to use types like
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.UnsignedInteger32` which can only contain a
32-bit unsigned integer. (Which is very popular as e.g. a primary key type
in a relational database.)

For floating-point numbers, use the ``Decimal`` type with a pre-defined scale
and precision. E.g. ``Decimal(16, 4)`` can represent a 16-digit number in total
which can have up to 4 decimal digits, which could be used e.g. as a nice
monetary type. By the way, Spyne does not include types like ISO-4217 compliant
'currency' and 'monetary' types. [#]_ They are actually really easy to
implement. Needless to say, patches are welcome!

Please see the :mod:`spyne.model.primitive` documentation for more details
regarding number handling in Spyne.

Strings
^^^^^^^

There are two string types in Spyne: :class:`spyne.model.primitive.Unicode` and
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.String` whose native types are ``unicode`` and
``str`` respectively.

Unlike the Python ``str``, the Spyne ``String`` is not for arbitrary byte
streams.
You should not use it unless you are absolutely, positively sure that
you need to deal with text data with an unknown encoding.
In all other cases, you should just use the ``Unicode`` type. They actually
look the same from outside, this distinction is made just to properly deal
with the quirks surrounding Python-2's ``unicode`` type.

Remember that you have the ``ByteArray`` and ``File`` types at your disposal
when you need to deal with arbitrary byte streams.

The ``String`` type will be just an alias for ``Unicode``
once Spyne gets ported to Python 3. It might even be deprecated and removed in the
future, so make sure you are using either ``Unicode`` or ``ByteArray`` in your
interface definitions.

``File``, ``ByteArray``, ``Unicode`` and ``String`` are all arbitrary-size in
their vanilla versions. Don't forget to customize them with additional restrictions
when implementing public services.

See also the configuration parameters of your favorite transport for more
information on request size restriction and other precautions against
potential abuse.

Date/Time Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Date`, :class:`spyne.model.primitive.Time` and
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.DateTime` correspond to the native types
``datetime.date``, ``datetime.time`` and ``datetime.datetime`` respectively.
Spyne supports working with both offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes.

As long as you return the proper native types, you should be fine.

As a side note, the `dateutil <http://labix.org/python-dateutil>`_ package is
mighty useful for dealing with dates, times and timezones. Highly recommended!

Spatial Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spyne comes with six basic spatial types that are supported by popular packages
like `PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`_ and
`Shapely <`http://toblerity.github.com/shapely/`>_. These are the

These are provided as ``Unicode`` subclasses that just define proper
constraints to force the incoming string to be WKT-compliant. WKB is not yet
supported.

The incoming types are not parsed, but you can use ``shapely.wkb.loads()``
function to convert them to native geometric types.

:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Point`, :class:`spyne.model.primitive.Line` and
:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Polygon` and also their multi-variants, which are

:class:`spyne.model.primitive.MultiPoint`, :class:`spyne.model.primitive.MultiLine`
and :class:`spyne.model.primitive.MultiPolygon`.

Miscellanous Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`spyne.model.primitive.AnyUri`

:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Boolean`

:class:`spyne.model.primitive.Uuid`

Dynamic Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`spyne.model.primitive.AnyDict`

:class:`spyne.model.primitive.AnyXml`

Enum

Binary

Complex
